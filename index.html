        <p>To Amani, the sweet soul I have the joy of knowing,</p>
       
        <p>I write to you from a distance that feels infinite yet impossibly small. The miles stretch between us like an unspoken poem, yet even in this space, I find you everywhere — in the air I breathe, in the quiet corners of my mind where your name lingers like a melody only I can hear.</p>

        <p>03 January 2025. That night, the Moon and Venus met in the sky, just as we met across the distance. I remember looking up, wondering if you were watching too, if you felt the same quiet awe at how two souls could find each other across the vastness of time and space.  I found you in the glow of a screen, a presence that felt like warmth in the cold expanse of night. Our words started shyly, yet somehow, it felt as though I had known you forever. Your voice wrapped around me like a familiar melody, and I held onto that feeling, letting it take root in the spaces between our messages.</p>

        <p>02 February 2025. As the Moon and Venus find each other once more, the universe seems to conspire for us, creating another moment of perfect synchronicity. This time, we spoke our feelings aloud. It’s no longer just whispers between the lines. You said my name, and the world around us softened. The distance between us vanished, as if it had never existed. No grand explosion, no cosmic shift — just the quiet certainty that I was yours, and you were mine.</p>

        <p>03 February 2025. Venus shines once more, and I can’t help but think of you, gazing at the same sky. I hope you feel that no matter how far apart we are, you are always with me. My thoughts find their way to you like the tide to the shore, inevitable and endless.</p>

        <p>You are the echo that reverberates through the deepest corners of my heart, filling the space between us with a warmth that is both gentle and unyielding. Your presence is a constant I carry, as natural as breath itself. You are a light I cannot quite touch, a warmth that lingers just beyond my grasp. I see your hand, fingers tracing patterns in the air, and it feels as though your touch has already left an imprint on my skin. In the silence of the night, I hear your voice that is soft, warm, and just for me. I can almost feel your heartbeat as if it were my own, as though the distance between us is nothing but a dream we will one day wake from, in time. You exist like a truth I am still learning to trace, like a concept just beyond my understanding, yet always pulling me closer, like gravity itself. You fill the air I breathe with a weight that feels light, as if my heart were made only to keep the rhythm of us. And with every word I write, I send it through the fold of time, hoping it reaches you, hoping you feel it like a promise, a whisper shared across infinity. We are but whispers in a universe that will eventually forget us, but in these whispers, I am yours.</p>

        <p>I’ve watched the world around me blur in the wake of your smile, and in that instant, I realized how even the briefest glance can carve a new constellation in the sky. The stars, the moon, the planets — I believe they had no choice but to align so our paths would cross, no matter the time, no matter the space.</p>

        <p>I will wait for the next conjunction, and the next, and the next — until distance is just a word, and I can finally hold you close. Until then, I will carry you with me, in the quiet spaces, in the corners of my thoughts, just as you are—no more, no less.</p>
        
        <p>I love you always, in all ways.</p>

        <p>With all the space and time I can give,</p>

        <p>Leigh</p>
